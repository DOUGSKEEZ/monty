Yesterday's Accomplishments: Backend Fixes & Metrics Implementation
1. Backend Server Architecture Improvements
We transformed your Monty application with robust architectural patterns:

API Dashboard: Fixed the service status dashboard showing all services and their health
Modular Server Architecture: Implemented a server that starts listening first, then initializes services non-blocking
Prometheus Integration: Added comprehensive metrics collection to monitor application performance

2. Prometheus Metrics Implementation
We added sophisticated metrics collection to multiple system components:

HTTP Request Metrics: Recording request counts, status codes, and latency
Service Health Metrics: Tracking the status of all services (ready, warning, error)
Circuit Breaker Metrics: Monitoring circuit states (closed, open, half-open)
Retry Metrics: Tracking retry attempts and success rates
System Metrics: Monitoring Node.js memory, CPU, and event loop performance

3. Key Components Integration
We integrated metrics with critical reliability components:

ServiceRegistry: Records service health status changes in Prometheus
CircuitBreaker: Reports circuit state transitions to detect failing dependencies
RetryHelper: Records retry attempts for visibility into transient failures
ServiceWatchdog: Tracks recovery attempts for self-healing capabilities

4. Prometheus Server Setup
We configured a Prometheus server to collect and store metrics:

Scraping Configuration: Set up to collect metrics from your application endpoint
Adjusted Scrape Interval: Changed from 15s to 60s to reduce overhead
Metrics Storage: Prometheus stores time-series data for historical analysis
Query Interface: Provides a way to retrieve and analyze metrics

5. Key Concepts Learned

Observability Triad: Metrics, logging, and tracing work together for system visibility
Pull-based Metrics: Prometheus pulls metrics rather than your app pushing them
Dimensional Data: Metrics use labels (like method, route, status_code) for flexible querying
Self-Healing Patterns: Circuit breakers, retries, and watchdogs create resilient systems
Port Conflicts: Discovered and resolved port conflict between Grafana and frontend (both used 3000)
